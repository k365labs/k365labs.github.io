              <p>You'll need the right people with the right skills in the right roles and places at precisely the right time. And in today’s complex global marketplace, that’s quite a challenge.</p>
              <p>In fact, only 35 percent of senior HR executives believe their organizations are able to allocate their workforce efficiently, and just 31 percent are effective at rapidly developing new skills.Knowing what skills and capabilities you have in your workforce and employing a common skills taxonomy allows you to move people around.</p>
              <p>As you plan and budget for the next financial year, make sure your team has the skills to drive your projects’ success. IDC reports that the most important factor in determining an IT project’s success is the team’s skill level*.</p>
              <p>As the Chief Executive Officer of K365labs, I would like to introduce our theme for this year, namely “Strategy and Transformation”. K365labs’s strategy and transformation program combines K365labs's management consulting capabilities to enable client success through executable strategies, and provide differentiation through technology-enabled transformation. Through the program, we collaborate with our clients to turn today's complexity into competitive advantage, by transforming their organizations to enable growth, increase effectiveness and drive efficiency.
